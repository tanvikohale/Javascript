The Difference Between Statement and Expression.

EXPRESSION 

~ An Expression is anything that produces a value.
It can be single value, a math calculation ,a function call, or a variable.

You can put them inside other expressions or inside statements.

Example: 10 (just a value)
         5 + 3 (math expressions)
         "Hello" + "!" (String Expression) 


STATEMENT

A Statement is a complete instruction for the computer to do something.
The statements dont't always return a value, they just perform actions.
They dont't give the value directly, but they control the flow of the program.

Example: let a = 10; (variable declaration)
         
Statements are like commands:
“Do this.”
“Check this condition.”
“Repeat this.”
“Create a variable.”
“Call this function.”
